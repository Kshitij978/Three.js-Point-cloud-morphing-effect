# 3D Particle Morphing

An interactive WebGL visualization where particles morph between different 3D shapes. This project demonstrates the use of Three.js for 3D rendering and GSAP for smooth animations.

[**Live Demo**](https://kshitij978.github.io/Three.js-Point-cloud-morphing-effect/)

## Features

- **Smooth Morphing**: Transition particles between 3D models (Queen, Pawn, and Explosion).
- **Surface Sampling**: Particles are dynamically distributed on the surface of 3D meshes.
- **Interactive UI**: Change particle size, animation speed, and colors in real-time.
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js**: 3D engine and WebGL rendering.
- **GSAP**: Animation and interpolation.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for better code structure.
- **Vite**: Modern frontend build tool.
